# LePython
Like Python, but in French.

I love two languages: **French** and **Python**. *So I decided to combine them)*

## About
This is Python, where all keywords are written in French. I'm learning French and Python, so it makes sense. This funny idea came to my mind one day and I realized it in one day.

If there are any mistakes or ideas for improvement, you know what needs to be done;)
